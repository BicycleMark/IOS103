      <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is a Xamarin.iOS class. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin.iOS development environment with either a simulator or a device to run the exercise on. Please see the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/win-setup">Windows setup</a> or <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/mac-setup">macOS setup</a> pages if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            One key aspect to building a successful application is making it look visually appealing. An easy way to do that is to add images to your application, however, there are a few challenges associated with that. In this course we will learn how to add images to our applications
            and ensure they look sharp and consistent across all devices.
         </p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Include an image in your Application Bundle using Build Action</li>
           <li>Display an image with UIImageView</li>
           <li>Show an image at constant size across devices using points</li>
           <li>Provide crisp images across all devices</li>
           <li>Organize images using an asset catalog</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>
            Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/ios103">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/ios103/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><div class="objective">Include an image in your Application Bundle using Build Action</div>
            <a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, we will add an image into our application and ensure it's Build Action is set to BundleResource.</li>

            <li><div class="objective">Display an image with UIImageView</div>
            <a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, we will visualize a UIImage in our application.</li>
            <li>
              <div class="objective">Show an image at constant size across devices using points</div>
            <a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, we will use points to ensure an image is the same size across devices.</li>
            <li>
              <div class="objective">Provide crisp images across all devices</div>
            <a href="./parts/part4.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, we will add multiple images at different resolutions to allow iOS to select the best for the device.</li>
            <li>
              <div class="objective">Organize images using an asset catalog</div>
            <a href="./parts/part5.html">Exercise</a>
            <br />
            In this exercise, we will create an Image Set to group together multi-resolution images.</li>
        </ol>
